# LRE ThinkTime Configuration

The `LreThinkTimeValidator` class validates and parses **ThinkTime** configurations for LRE (LoadRunner Enterprise)
groups.  

ThinkTime defines delays between requests to simulate real user behavior.

## ThinkTime Types

| Type     | Description                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IGNORE` | No think time is applied.                                                  |
| `REPLAY` | Replay recorded think time, optional limit in seconds.                     |
| `MODIFY` | Modify recorded think time by a limit and/or multiply factor.              |
| `RANDOM` | Random think time, between min/max percentages, optional limit in seconds. |

---

## Valid Examples

```yaml
# No think time
ThinkTime: ignore

# Replay recorded think time, limit to 10 seconds max
ThinkTime: replay:10

# Modify think time: limit to 20 seconds, multiply by 1.5
ThinkTime: modify:20*1.5

# Random think time: between 50% and 150% of recorded, limit to 30 seconds
ThinkTime: random:50-150:30

# Random think time: between 80% and 120% of recorded (no time limit)
ThinkTime: random:80-120

# Modify think time: only multiply by 2.0 (no time limit)
ThinkTime: modify:*2.0
```

## Parsing Rules

### 1. Type extraction

* The first part of the string before `:` defines the type.

* Valid types: `ignore`, `replay`, `modify`, `random`.

### 2. Configuration extraction

* Everything after the first `:` is the configuration string.

* Rules differ per type:

| Type     | Config Format                            | Notes                          | 
|----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `IGNORE` | Optional empty                           | Any config is ignored.         |
| `REPLAY` | `[limitSeconds]`                         | Limit think time in seconds.   |
| `MODIFY` | `[limitSeconds]*[factor]` or `*[factor]` | Multiply factor is optional.   |
| `RANDOM` | `minPercent-maxPercent[:limitSeconds]`   | Percentage range is mandatory. |

### 3. Validation

* Percentages must be integers.
* Min percentage â‰¤ Max percentage.
* Limits and multiply factors must be positive numbers.
